This is a Flutter project designed to work on both iOS and Android platforms. The following instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for Android development)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (for iOS development on macOS)
- A code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

Ensure that the Flutter SDK path is added to your system environment variables.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-flutter-project.git
    cd your-flutter-project
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Run the project:**

    ### On Android:

    - Ensure that an Android emulator is running or a physical device is connected.
    - Run the following command:

      ```bash
      flutter run
      ```

    ### On iOS (macOS only):

    - Open iOS Simulator using the following command:

      ```bash
      open -a Simulator
      ```

    - Run the project:

      ```bash
      flutter run
      ```

4. **Build the project:**

    If you want to build the APK (for Android) or IPA (for iOS):

    ### Android APK:

    ```bash
    flutter build apk
    ```

    The APK file will be located in the `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/` directory.

    ### iOS IPA (macOS only):

    ```bash
    flutter build ios
    ```

    The IPA file will be located in the `build/ios/ipa/` directory. Note that building for iOS requires a physical macOS machine.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Make sure that all prerequisites are installed correctly.
- Run `flutter doctor` to check for any missing dependencies or issues.
